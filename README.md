# RadioX
## Distributed Radio
Currently this app can be used to load and play music in a browser. It is very basic.
RadioX is intended to be hosted on IPFS. The idea is to use a few centralized resources as possible and practical. This may involve removing node packages and using vanilla JavasSript without libraries and frameworks. There are plans to incorporate users via wallet addresses (ethereum) and to allow users to share and stream media.

## ENS Location
To view the application being hosted on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) through ENS (Ethereum Naming Service), you can visit:
- (radiox.eth)[radiox.eth] *This will only resolve on browsers that support ENS, such as Brave and Opera*
- (https://radiox.eth.link)[https://radiox.eth.link] *This will with any as it is DNS over HTTP*


## To run 
```cd radio```
```npm install```
```npm run start```
